Search loads candidate rows, reconstructs one (n, 256) int32 matrix with np.frombuffer(...).reshape(...), computes squared L2 distance against the query vector in a single vectorized np.sum((mat - q) ** 2, axis=1), and takes top-k with np.argsort.

Co-built the RAG pipeline on the PC hub: ingestion, chunking, embedding, vector storage, retrieval, rerank, LLM synthesis.',

Without explicit registration, ONNX Runtime silently falls back to CPU per-node rather than raising an error: the model runs, just slowly, with no warning. Fixed with explicit provider registration plus an assertion that the first effective provider really is QNNExecutionProvider. Accelerator fallback order is Hexagon NPU (HTP), then Adreno GPU, then CPU — opening a fresh session per candidate, since one QNN session targets one accelerator.',
